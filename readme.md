# Express GraphQL Backend Boilerplate

I published this as my go to boilerplate for Express based GraphQL API.
It's completely written in TypeScript and uses the following technologies:

- Express sessions with Redis
- Database: MongoDB with typegoose (a TypeScript wrapper for mongoose) - which can easily be converted to TypeORM.
- GraphQL: Apollo Server

It will evolve with time, feel free to contribute, suggestions are more than welcome
